This repository contains the source code from Alex Edwards' "Let's Go" book. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning the Go programming language. It provides a comprehensive and accessible guide for beginners and valuable insights for experienced developers.
You can find more information about the book [here](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net).
I personally enjoyed reading this book, although I encountered some difficulties with text formatting. Nevertheless, I believe that this fantastic book will greatly assist others in their journey to learn Go.
The code in this repository has been tested with Go version 1.20.
